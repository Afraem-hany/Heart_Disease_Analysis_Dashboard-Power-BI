# Heart_Disease_Analysis_Dashboard-Power BI


## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard built with **Power BI** to analyze a heart disease dataset. The goal of the project is to provide meaningful insights into the relationship between different medical factors and the likelihood of heart disease.

The dashboard is divided into three sections:
1. **Overview Page** – Demographic distribution by gender and age categories.
2. **Vital Signs Page** – Medical indicators including resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, ST depression (oldpeak), and number of vessels colored (CA).
3. **Risk Factors Page** – Clinical factors such as cholesterol levels, chest pain type, resting ECG results, slope, and fasting blood sugar.

## Key Features
- Multi-page dashboard structure for better storytelling.  
- Interactive filters (age and gender) for detailed segmentation.  
- Multiple chart types (bar, line, and area charts) for effective visualization.  
- Simple and medically themed design for clarity and relevance.  

---

## Insights
- Males over 50 years old show a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to females.  
- Elevated ST depression (oldpeak) is strongly associated with heart disease.  
- Chest pain type and ECG results are significant indicators related to the presence of heart disease.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard design.  
- **Dataset** – Publicly available *Heart Disease Dataset*.
